# Java-1.8-Features


## Introduction:
Welcome to Java 8! This document provides a brief overview of some of the key features introduced in Java 8. These features aim to enhance productivity, readability, and performance of Java code.

## Key Features:

1. **Lambda Expressions:**
    
   - Lambda expressions enable the functional programming approach in Java.
   - It provides a brief way to define anonymous methods, enhancing code clarity by allowing functions to be passed as arguments to methods.

2. **Stream API:**
    - Stream API facilitates functional-style operations on streams of elements, such as filtering, mapping, reducing, and iterating.
    - It provides a fluent API for processing collections in a declarative manner.

3. **Functional Interfaces:**
    - Functional interfaces have a single abstract method and are eligible for use with lambda expressions.
    - The `@FunctionalInterface` annotation ensures that an interface is a functional interface.

4. **Default Methods:**
    - Default methods allow interfaces to have methods with implementations.
    - This feature facilitates the addition of new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.

5. **Method References:**
   - Java 8 Method reference is used to refer method of functional interface . It is compact and easy form of lambda expression. Each time when you are using lambda expression to just referring a method, you can replace your lambda expression with method reference.

6. **Optional Class:**
    - The `Optional` class provides a container object which may or may not contain a non-null value.
    - It helps in avoiding null pointer exceptions and encourages cleaner, more expressive code.

7. **Date and Time API (java.time):**
    - Java 8 introduces a new Date and Time API, located in the `java.time` package.
    - It provides improved date and time functionality, including immutable date-time classes, fluent API, and support for time zones.

   
## Conclusion:
Java 8 introduces several powerful features that enhance the language's capabilities and promote more efficient, readable, and maintainable code. These basic examples serve as an introduction to these features, and further exploration is encouraged to leverage Java 8's potential for modern software development.
